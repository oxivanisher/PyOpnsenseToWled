# PyOpnsenseToWled

This simple script is aimed to poll you OpnSense gateway monitoring stats and send colored alerts to WLED nodes to alert
you of a badly working Internet uplink. You can thank the following two those companies for the need for this script
since their service is just plain bad:
* [Quickline](https://quickline.ch/)
* [EWK](https://ewk.ch)
